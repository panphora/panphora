*The act of creating bends the world around you, opening the space around you into something you didn't see before.*

**What I worked on today:**

I posted [the sixth chapter of "A Boy Meets a Dragon"](http://lovenicely.com/a-boy-meets-a-dragon-6/), along with an audio recording and illustration by me, to lovenicely.com, a fantasy/fiction blog I run.
