*In the process of becoming who you want to be, you will pass into and through identities you don't want to be. The fun part is not becoming what you want to be, but in slowly realizing that it may not be exactly what you thought it was.*

**What I worked on today:**

I put three of my favorite domains up for sale: riotpost.com, jetplot.com, and ohnote.com. I spent a lot of money doing this. Unfortunately, none of them sold.
