*When I feel ill or stressed, I know I haven't been paying attention to my body lately.*

**What I worked on today:**

I added a new chapter of ["A Boy Meets a Dragon"](http://lovenicely.com/a-boy-meets-a-dragon-7/) to lovenicely.com. Usually, this includes text written by me, an audio recording recorded by me, and a simple illustration drawn by me. However, this time I hired a brilliant artist to do the illustration and it looks wonderful! The artist's name is Choo and she has a wonderful [blog](http://choodraws.tumblr.com/) where she posts a lot of her artwork.
