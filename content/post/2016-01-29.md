*Leave people behind. Most of the time they'll catch up to you later. Sometimes you'll realize they were moving so slowly just to help you along.*

**What I worked on today:**

Started implementing payment processing on [Artisfy](https://artisfy.com/). Improved the payment form dramatically with the [jquery.payments.js library](https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment) from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). I also made a [t-shirt for my girlfriend](http://www.redbubble.com/people/panphora/works/20755922-my-thai-vegan-cafe) of the logo of her favorite restaurant, [My Thai Vegan Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-thai-vegan-cafe-boston-3).
