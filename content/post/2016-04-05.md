**What I worked on today:**

Over the past week I've been learning about some blogging software called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I used it to convert this website, [ohnote.com](http://ohnote.com/), and [smashingthingstogether.com](http://smashingthingstogether.com/) into static websites. Since hosting static wesbites is free and fast on GitHub pages, this is saving me $10/month. I'm also working on a blog post to help guide other people who want to do this. It's going to be called something like "Make a simple static blog with Hugo and deploy it to GitHub Pages: An easy, step-by-step tutorial"
