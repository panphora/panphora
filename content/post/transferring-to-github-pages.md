*If you want to hear your inner voice, it can sometimes help to write.*

**What I worked on today:**

Transferred two blogs, [oh note!](http://ohnote.com/) and [Smashing Things Together](http://smashingthingstogether.com/), to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from [Runkite](https://www.runkite.com/). Saves me $10/month and I finished the transfer just two days before the subscription was set to renew!
