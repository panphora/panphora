*When you are terrified, wait. Terror turns into something new when you give it enough room.*

**What I worked on today:**

Gave a presentation at a Meteor.js meetup and wrote a followup blog post for smashingthingstogether.com, [The JavaScript Runtime, Fibers, and Meteor.wrapAsync (Meteor.js)](http://smashingthingstogether.com/the-javascript-runtime-fibers-and-meteor-wrapasync/). It's a pretty deep look at how JavaScript works and what makes Meteor.js so cool.
