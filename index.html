<p><strong>What I worked on today:</strong></p>

<p>Over the past week I&rsquo;ve been learning about some blogging software called <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I used it to convert this website, <a href="http://ohnote.com/">ohnote.com</a>, and <a href="http://smashingthingstogether.com/">smashingthingstogether.com</a> into static websites. Since hosting static wesbites is free and fast on GitHub pages, this is saving me $10/month. I&rsquo;m also working on a blog post to help guide other people who want to do this. It&rsquo;s going to be called something like &ldquo;Make a simple static blog with Hugo and deploy it to GitHub Pages: An easy, step-by-step tutorial&rdquo;</p>

    <p><p><em>When I feel ill or stressed, I know I haven&rsquo;t been paying attention to my body lately.</em></p>

<p><strong>What I worked on today:</strong></p>

<p>I added a new chapter of <a href="http://lovenicely.com/a-boy-meets-a-dragon-7/">&ldquo;A Boy Meets a Dragon&rdquo;</a> to lovenicely.com. Usually, this includes text written by me, an audio recording recorded by me, and a simple illustration drawn by me. However, this time I hired a brilliant artist to do the illustration and it looks wonderful! The artist&rsquo;s name is Choo and she has a wonderful <a href="http://choodraws.tumblr.com/">blog</a> where she posts a lot of her artwork.</p>

I also made a <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/panphora/works/20755922-my-thai-vegan-cafe">t-shirt for my girlfriend</a> of the logo of her favorite restaurant, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-thai-vegan-cafe-boston-3">My Thai Vegan Cafe</a>.</p>
