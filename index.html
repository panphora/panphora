        <p>Over the past week I&rsquo;ve been learning about some blogging software called <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I used it to convert this website, ohnote.com (no longer up), and <a href="https://smashingthingstogether.com/">smashingthingstogether.com</a> into static websites. Since hosting static wesbites is free and fast on GitHub pages, this is saving me $10/month. I&rsquo;m also working on a blog post to help guide other people who want to do this. It&rsquo;s going to be called something like &ldquo;Make a simple static blog with Hugo and deploy it to GitHub Pages: An easy, step-by-step tutorial&rdquo;</p>
